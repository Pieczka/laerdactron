==========

This is a very experimental article.  I want to try to explain how 
a computer works, starting from the idea of an electron,
passing through digital circuits hitting memory and processor.

Environment
-----------

I am using LaTeX, to compile it you should have some LaTeX packages
installed on your computer, then type `make` to create the final PDF.

Dependencies
------------

I don't know exatcly all dependencies, with texlive full package
probably you will get all needed.

Known dependencies:

* TIPA -- International Phonetic Alphabet package for LaTeX
