\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Electromagnetism}

The ancient Greek philosophers noticed that amber attracted small
pieces of straw. Also, they were aware some ``rocks'' found in nature,
now known as magnetite, were able to atrir the iron.  These two
observations are the origins of the electricity and magnetism sciences.
Both were developed independetly until 1820, when Hans Christian Oersted
discovered a connection between them: an electric current running through 
a wire cause the deflection of a compass magnetic needle.  From these
observations, we come to the electronic age where we live in (electron,
from Greek
$\eta\lambda\epsilon\kappa\rho o\nu$ \textipa{/E:lektron/}, 
means amber) \cite{halliday}.
